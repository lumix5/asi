"""UPGD (Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent) learner.

Implements a multi-head UPGD learner after Elsayed & Mahmood (ICLR 2024,
"Addressing Loss of Plasticity and Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual
Learning"): standard SGD augmented with utility-scaled perturbations of
low-utility weights, instead of the hard slot replacement used by
generate-and-test methods (the Dohare et al. loss-of-plasticity /
continual-backprop line).

The intuition: weights with low utility (small product of weight magnitude
and gradient magnitude) are not contributing to the prediction and are
"dead". UPGD adds noise to such weights, scaled by ``(1 - u_norm)^beta``,
which lets them drift back into a useful regime without destroying any
structure that the network has already learned.

This learner deliberately extends the paper algorithm. Its utility trace is
the absolute product ``|w * grad|`` with a power gate, where the paper uses
the signed first-order estimate ``-grad * w``, and it layers several
optional mechanisms on top of the paper update: ObGD-style step bounding
with an online-adapted kappa, gradient-alignment meta-plasticity for
trunk/head step multipliers, hidden-unit recycling, and a family of simplex
readouts (softmax/CE, factorized label-map adapters, two-timescale
fast+slow heads). For a source-profiled implementation faithful to the
published paper and its released code, use
:mod:`alberta_framework.core.canonical_upgd`.

Architecture mirrors :class:`MultiHeadMLPLearner`: a shared MLP trunk
(``Input -> [Dense -> LayerNorm -> LeakyReLU] x N``) with ``n_heads``
linear output heads. Utility tracking and perturbation are applied only
to the trunk hidden weight matrices -- biases and output (head) weights
and biases are updated with plain SGD with no perturbation.

class UPGDLearner:
    """Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent learner (Elsayed & Mahmood, ICLR 2024).

    Architecture mirrors :class:`MultiHeadMLPLearner`:

    ``Input -> [Dense(H) -> LayerNorm -> LeakyReLU] x N -> {Head_i: Dense(1)} x n_heads``

    When ``use_layer_norm=False``, layer norms are dropped.

    Each step performs:

    1. Forward pass + ``jax.grad`` of ``0.5 * sum_active((pred - target)^2)``
       w.r.t. all trunk and head parameters.
    2. Standard SGD step ``param -= step_size * grad``.
    3. For each hidden weight matrix, update the running utility:
       ``u = decay * u + (1 - decay) * |w * grad|``.
    4. Compute per-layer normalized utility ``u_norm = u / (u_max + eps)``
       and add perturbation ``sigma * (1 - u_norm)^beta * noise``
       to the post-SGD weights.

    Perturbation is applied every ``perturbation_interval`` steps. Hidden
    biases and output (head) parameters receive plain SGD with no
    perturbation -- the heads must track per-task signal so should not
    be perturbed away.

    NaN targets mask inactive heads: their contribution to the loss is
    zero, so their gradients (and thus utility updates and SGD steps)
    are zero for that step.

    Attributes:
        n_heads: Number of prediction heads
        hidden_sizes: Tuple of hidden layer sizes
        step_size: SGD learning rate
        bounder: Optional gradient bounder (e.g. ObGDBounding)
        utility_decay: EMA decay for the running utility
        perturbation_sigma: Base Gaussian noise scale
        perturbation_beta: Exponent applied to ``(1 - u_norm)``
        perturbation_interval: Apply perturbation every N steps
        perturbation_warmup_steps: Number of initial updates with zero
            perturbation.
        perturbation_noise: Noise distribution used for weight perturbations.
            ``"normal"`` reproduces Gaussian UPGD; ``"rademacher"`` uses
            bounded ±1 noise, a cheaper and less heavy-tailed mutation.
        perturbation_ramp_steps: Number of updates over which perturbation
            linearly ramps from zero to ``perturbation_sigma`` after warmup.
        sparsity: Fraction of weights zeroed at init
        leaky_relu_slope: Negative slope for LeakyReLU
        use_layer_norm: Whether to apply parameterless layer normalization
        loss_normalization: How to scale the active-head squared-error loss.
            ``"sum"`` leaves per-head gradients undiluted and is the Step 2
            multi-task default. ``"mean"`` divides by the number of active
            heads, matching earlier UPGD behavior. ``"target_density"``
            divides by the number of nonzero active target components, so
            dense vector targets behave like ``"mean"`` while sparse one-hot
            targets behave like ``"sum"``. ``"target_structure"`` uses
            ``"sum"`` only for non-negative simplex targets and otherwise uses
            ``"mean"``; this preserves one-hot classification pressure without
            misclassifying dense zero-valued regression heads or multilabel
            targets as sparse one-hot tasks.
        positive_target_loss_scale: MSE loss multiplier for active targets
            greater than zero.
        negative_target_loss_scale: MSE loss multiplier for active targets
            less than or equal to zero. Values below ``1`` reduce the flood of
            negative updates in sparse multi-task classification targets while
            preserving the default behavior when left at ``1``.
        head_gradient_scale: Optional extra scaling for output-head gradients.
            ``"none"`` leaves head gradients as produced by the loss.
            ``"active_count"`` multiplies head gradients by the number of
            active heads, so each task head adapts as if trained independently
            while trunk gradients can remain mean-normalized.
        head_step_size_multiplier: Additional fixed multiplier applied to
            output-head steps only. This lets task heads track non-stationary
            targets faster without increasing trunk plasticity.
        head_bias_step_size_multiplier: Additional fixed multiplier applied
            only to output-head bias steps after ``head_step_size_multiplier``.
            Values below ``1`` slow global head bias drift while leaving
            class-discriminative head weights plastic.
        head_loss_pressure_gate_ratio: When positive, boosts output-head
            plasticity only when the fast loss EMA exceeds this multiple of
            the slow loss EMA.
        head_loss_pressure_multiplier: Maximum additional multiplicative
            output-head step-size boost under loss pressure. ``0`` disables
            adaptive head pressure.
        head_loss_pressure_warmup_steps: Number of initial steps before the
            adaptive head-pressure boost can turn on.
        head_repetition_multiplier: Maximum additional output-head step-size
            boost from locally repeated targets. This is useful when a stream
            presents long target blocks: output heads can track the current
            block faster without increasing trunk plasticity everywhere.
        head_repetition_decay: EMA decay for repeated-target detection.
        head_repetition_delta_threshold: Mean absolute target-vector change at
            or below which consecutive targets count as repeated.
        head_repetition_pressure_threshold: EMA level below which repeated-target
            pressure is zero. This filters out accidental isolated repeats while
            preserving persistent blocks.
        head_repetition_warmup_steps: Number of initial steps before the
            repeated-target boost can turn on.
        unit_replacement_rate: Optional hidden-unit recycling rate per step,
            expressed as a fraction of the layer's mature units; at most one
            unit per layer is recycled per step. ``0`` disables recycling
            while still tracking per-unit utility.
        unit_maturity_threshold: Minimum age before a hidden unit can be
            recycled.
        unit_utility_decay: Optional EMA decay for hidden-unit utilities. When
            ``None``, reuses ``utility_decay``.
        unit_long_utility_decay: EMA decay for the slower retained-value
            hidden-unit utility.
        unit_gradient_decay: EMA decay for per-unit current gradient demand.
        unit_replacement_criterion: Which mature unit to recycle:
            ``"low_utility"`` preserves prior behavior; ``"stale_gradient_ratio"``
            recycles units with low current gradient demand relative to retained
            utility; ``"low_long_and_gradient"`` recycles units low on both
            retained value and current demand.
        unit_replacement_fanin: How to initialize recycled incoming weights.
            ``"random"`` uses sparse random init; ``"gradient_columns"`` samples
            nonzero fan-in columns from high current-gradient columns.
        unit_replacement_loss_gate_ratio: When positive, recycle only when a
            fast loss EMA exceeds ``ratio * slow loss EMA``.
        unit_replacement_budget_mode: How replacement budget accumulates.
            ``"always"`` preserves the original behavior: budget accumulates
            every step, even while gates are closed. ``"gated"`` accumulates
            only when the current candidate passes the configured loss and
            score gates. ``"loss_pressure"`` accumulates proportionally to the
            fast/slow loss-ratio surplus above the loss gate, so replacement
            pressure rises with an online non-stationarity signal without
            storing closed-gate replacement debt.
        track_unit_utilities: Whether to maintain row-level hidden-unit
            utility traces when hidden-unit recycling is disabled. Disable for
            lean UPGD benchmarks that use per-weight utility perturbation but
            no unit recycling.
        track_gradient_history: Whether to copy current gradients into state
            when no gradient-alignment meta-rule is active. Disable for lean
            non-meta UPGD benchmarks to reduce carry traffic.
        adaptive_kappa_mode: Optional online control law for ObGD ``kappa``.
            ``"none"`` uses the configured bounder unchanged, and
            ``bounder=None`` disables bounding in every mode. When a bounder is
            configured, every other mode uses plain ObGD at
            ``adaptive_kappa_base`` (scaled by the law), so it must be an
            :class:`ObGDBounding` with that same kappa. ``"loss_ratio"``
            computes an effective kappa from the learner's fast/slow loss EMAs,
            lowering kappa when fast loss exceeds slow loss and raising it when
            the stream appears stable. ``"gradient_alignment"`` learns a
            bounded kappa multiplier from consecutive gradient alignment.
        adaptive_kappa_meta_step_size: Meta step-size for learned kappa log
            multiplier. Positive gradient alignment lowers kappa, permitting
            larger bounded updates; gradient reversals raise kappa.
        adaptive_kappa_meta_min_multiplier: Minimum learned kappa multiplier.
        adaptive_kappa_meta_max_multiplier: Maximum learned kappa multiplier.
        adaptive_kappa_meta_warmup_steps: Number of initial steps before the
            learned kappa multiplier can adapt.
        meta_plasticity_mode: Optional online control law for group plasticity.
            ``"gradient_alignment"`` learns bounded log step multipliers for
            trunk updates, head-weight updates, head-bias updates, and repeated
            target head plasticity from consecutive gradient alignment.
        meta_plasticity_step_size: Meta step-size for group log multipliers.
        meta_plasticity_min_multiplier: Minimum learned multiplier.
        meta_plasticity_max_multiplier: Maximum learned multiplier.
        meta_plasticity_warmup_steps: Number of initial steps before group
            plasticity multipliers can adapt.
        meta_plasticity_trunk_enabled: Whether group meta-plasticity can alter
            shared trunk updates.
        meta_plasticity_head_weight_enabled: Whether group meta-plasticity can
            alter output-head weight updates.
        meta_plasticity_head_bias_enabled: Whether group meta-plasticity can
            alter output-head bias updates.
        meta_plasticity_repetition_enabled: Whether group meta-plasticity can
            alter repeated-target head-plasticity gain.
        readout_loss_mode: Optional explicit output loss geometry. When left
            ``None``, it is derived from ``readout_mode`` for backward
            compatibility.
        readout_prediction_mode: Optional explicit output transform used for
            predictions and online metrics. When left ``None``, it is derived
            from ``readout_mode``.
        readout_robust_q: Generalized-cross-entropy ``q`` value for robust
            simplex readout losses.
        readout_label_adapter_step_size: Step-size for the fast label-map
            adapter used by ``factorized_simplex`` readout. The adapter is
            updated causally from the current prediction error on active
            non-negative simplex targets.
        readout_label_adapter_identity_regularization: Per-step pull toward
            the identity label map for ``factorized_simplex``.
        readout_label_adapter_entropy_regularization: Optional entropy-style
            row regularizer for the label map. ``0`` disables it.
        readout_label_adapter_floor: Non-negative floor applied before
            row-normalizing the label map after each adapter update.
        readout_fast_head_step_size_multiplier: Step-size multiplier for the

        readout_fast_head_bias_step_size_multiplier: Bias step-size multiplier
            for the fast simplex head used by ``two_timescale_simplex``.
        readout_fast_trunk_gradient_multiplier: Multiplier for sending the
            fast simplex head's CE gradient into the shared trunk. This is
            gated by the same adaptive simplex gate used for prediction.
        readout_fast_head_bounder_mode: How to bound fast simplex-head updates
            in ``two_timescale_simplex``. ``"shared"`` puts fast-head steps in
            the same ObGD budget as trunk and slow-head steps. ``"separate"``
            applies the same bounder/kappa to fast-head steps as a distinct
            readout group.
        readout_slow_simplex_gradient_multiplier: Slow-head MSE gradient
            multiplier when the adaptive simplex gate is fully open in
            ``two_timescale_simplex``. ``1`` keeps the slow branch always
            learning; ``0`` allocates the bounded gradient budget to the fast
            simplex branch on persistent simplex targets while preserving slow
            gradients when the gate is closed.
        readout_simplex_bias_decay: Per-update decay applied only to active
            output biases on non-negative unit-mass targets. ``0`` disables it.
        readout_simplex_bias_centering_rate: Per-update mean-bias removal rate
            for active output biases on non-negative unit-mass targets. ``1``
            exactly centers active biases after decay; ``0`` disables it.
