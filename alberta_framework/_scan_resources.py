Every per-module scan-sequence bound that rejects an oversized leading axis
before ``jnp.arange``/``jax.lax.scan`` traces derives from this constant, so
there is exactly one place to widen it deliberately.  The value is the
public last-fit across the retained suites (largest documented program:
10,000 steps); before it was canonical here it was duplicated as private
per-module literals.  The hang/OOM reports that established the class are
#2124, #2128, and #2441: an ``INT32_MAX``-legal config value must fail in
validation, not trace a multi-terabyte or unbounded scan.  A module may
declare a *smaller* budget for its own documented program, but must not
widen this ceiling locally.
