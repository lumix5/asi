"""Reduced-horizon mechanism-combination screening for the UPGD IPMNIST lane.

Screens optimizer/mechanism combinations that might exceed the reproduced
UPGD-W SOTA on the ICLR-2024 online Input-permuted MNIST protocol
(:mod:`alberta_framework.benchmarks.upgd_ipmnist`). The screening proxy is
the *same* protocol at a reduced horizon (default 60 tasks x 5,000 steps
instead of 200 tasks): because :func:`~alberta_framework.benchmarks.
upgd_ipmnist.build_schedule` folds the task index into per-seed keys, a
60-task run is an exact prefix of the corresponding 200-task run for the
same seed, so the proxy can be validated bit-for-bit against the completed
full-horizon shards in ``outputs/upgd_ipmnist/partials/``.

Screened combinations (all paired against a ``upgd_w_control`` arm run on
identical seeds):

- ``upgd_idbd`` / ``upgd_autostep``: UPGD's utility gate combined with
  per-weight step-size adaptation (IDBD, Meyer error-free variant; Autostep,
  Mahmood et al. 2012). The meta signal is the *gated* loss gradient — the
  update direction UPGD actually applies (perturbation noise excluded).
- ``upgd_cbp`` / ``adamw_cbp``: dormant-unit recycling in the style of
  Continual Backprop (Dohare et al.), adapted to the protocol MLP: per-unit
  utility EMA of ``|activation * dL/d_activation|``, accumulator-driven
  replacement of the lowest-utility mature unit, incoming weights redrawn
  from the protocol's PyTorch-default uniform init (upstream CBP uses a
  sparse init), outgoing weights zeroed, optimizer state reset per unit.
- ``upgd_w_idbd_swift``: the IDBD arm plus SwiftTD's two supervised-mode
  stabilizers (Javed, Sharifnassab & Sutton, RLC 2024; equation forms from
  :mod:`alberta_framework.core.swift_td`): a network-global overshoot bound
  capping ``sum_i alpha_i * z_i^2`` at ``eta``, and persistent step-size
  decay ``log_alpha_i += ln(eps) * z_i^2`` plus meta-trace reset whenever
  the bound triggers.
- ``upgd_w_fade_head``: FADE-style meta-learned per-parameter weight decay
  (Ramesh, Lewandowski & Schmidhuber, arXiv 2604.27063) on the output layer
  only -- ``lambda_i = exp(gamma_i)`` adapted through a forward-mode
  sensitivity trace of the head weights w.r.t. their log decay rates;
  UPGD-W unchanged elsewhere.
- ``upgd_l2init``: decoupled decay pulls toward the *initial* weights
  (L2-Init, Kumar et al.) instead of toward zero.
- ``upgd_ema_norm``: EMA input normalization (equation-parity with
  :class:`~alberta_framework.core.normalizers.EMANormalizer`) in front of
  the protocol MLP.
- ``upgd_w_wclip_*``: UPGD-W followed by per-layer weight clipping to
  ``[-kappa * s_l, +kappa * s_l]`` where ``s_l = 1/sqrt(fan_in)`` is the
  protocol's uniform-init bound (Elsayed, Lan, Lyle & Mahmood, RLC 2024),
  with ``kappa`` in {1, 2} crossed with weight decay in {0.01, 0}.
- ``upgd_w_localgate``: the lean UPGD-W step with the sigmoid utility gate
  normalized by the *per-tensor* utility max instead of the network-global
  max (the paper's local/global distinction).
- ``upgd_w_*`` hyperparameter-neighborhood star around the published
  UPGD-W configuration (sigma, utility decay, weight decay).
- ``guarded_cbp_adam``: AdamW+CBP (the screening leader) plus UPGD-style
  utility *protection only* — Adam's applied per-weight delta is scaled by
  ``1 - guard_scale * gate`` with the gate from the UPGD ``-w*g`` utility
  EMA; no perturbation (CBP supplies regeneration). ``guard_scale=0``
  reduces bit-exactly to ``adamw_cbp`` (pinned).
- ``adamw_cbp_noreset``: ``adamw_cbp`` WITHOUT the per-unit Adam
  moment/count reset at CBP replacement (the leader resets by default) —
  dissects whether optimizer-state freshness at recycle is load-bearing.
  ``cbp_replacement_rate=0`` reduces to ``adamw_control`` (pinned).
- ``upgd_w_sigma0``: lean UPGD-W with ``sigma=0`` — pure utility-gated
  SGD + decoupled decay, no perturbation; the noise draw (~85-90% of the
  UPGD step cost) is skipped entirely. Bit-exact against the control
  factory run at ``noise_std=0`` (pinned).
- ``upgd_alpha_utility``: UPGD-W whose protection signal is per-weight
  step-size relevance — an IDBD ``log_alpha``/trace pair maintained as a
  *passive statistic* on the raw gradient (never applied as a step size);
  the gate is a scale-free squashing of each weight's log-step-size drift
  from init. ``meta_step_size=0`` reduces to the closed-form half-gated
  step (pinned).
- ``adamw_cbp_{r3e5,r3e4,m50,m200}``: axis-aligned mini-star around the
  untuned ``adamw_cbp`` leader (replacement rate 3e-5/3e-4, maturity
  50/200).
- ``adamw_cbp_ema_norm``: the exact ``adamw_cbp`` update behind the exact
  ``upgd_ema_norm`` EMA input normalizer (same decay/eps/state threading) —
  composition of the screening's two orthogonal wins (input conditioning +
  capacity regeneration). ``norm_enabled=0`` skips the normalizer entirely
  and reduces bit-exactly to ``adamw_cbp`` (pinned).
- ``sgd_ema_norm``: the gate ablation closing the ``upgd_ema_norm`` /
  ``upgd_ema_norm_sigma0`` dissection — plain SGD with decoupled weight decay
  (``w <- w * (1 - lr*wd) - lr * grad``) behind the exact ``upgd_ema_norm``
  EMA input normalizer (same decay/eps/state threading); no utility, no gate,
  no noise. Pinned against a hand-computed trajectory, and the normalizer
  states are pinned bitwise against ``upgd_ema_norm``'s on a shared stream.
- ``sigma0_*``: single-axis frontier extensions on the confirmed
  ``upgd_ema_norm_sigma0`` champion (normalize + utility-gated SGD + decay,
  no noise), all built by one factory whose defaults reduce bit-exactly to
  that champion (pinned): normalizer decay {0.99, 0.9999} and epsilon
  {1e-6, 1e-4} stars (``ema_normalize`` already centers with the EMA mean,
  so the statistics themselves are the unexplored axis), stateless
  per-example RMS normalization of both hidden ReLU layers
  (``sigma0_hidden_norm``; no learnable parameters), utility-gate
  temperature ``sigmoid(beta * scaled_utility)`` with beta {0.5, 2}, and
  the per-tensor (local) gate normalization retested under conditioning
  (``sigma0_localgate``; measured -0.0008 on raw inputs).
- ``colnorm_gate`` / ``muon_gate`` / ``lion_gate``: update-rule family swaps
  under the ``sigma0_ndecay099`` champion's conditioning (EMA input
  normalizer decay 0.99 + the exact UPGD utility gate, no perturbation).
  Only the descent direction changes: per-fan-in-dimension RMS-scaled gated
  SGD (activation conditioning at the weight level), Nesterov momentum +
  Newton-Schulz orthogonalized 2-D updates (Muon), and gated Lion
  (sign of the interpolated momentum at ~0.1x step size, decay 0.05).
- ``rff_rls``: the pre-registered existential control — no backprop, no MLP.
  The champion's EMA input normalizer feeds frozen random Fourier features
  (``sqrt(2/m) * cos(Omega x + b)``, m=1024) into a streaming one-vs-all
  recursive-least-squares readout with forgetting factor 0.999. If a fixed
  random projection + exponential-window RLS matches the deep arms, the
  benchmark measures tracking rather than learning. Sentinel probes fail
  closed (there is no trained protocol MLP to probe).
- ``sgd_ema_norm_d099`` / ``wclip_ema_norm`` / ``fade_head_ema_norm`` /
  ``snr_ema_norm`` / ``l2init_ema_norm``: the reviewer comparison rows —
  the strongest published plasticity mechanisms (per-layer weight clipping,
  Elsayed et al. RLC 2024; FADE meta-learned head decay, arXiv 2604.27063;
  SNR hypothesis-test neuron resets, Farias & Jozefiak arXiv 2410.20098;
  L2-Init, Kumar et al.) re-implemented from their papers and run behind
  the champion's EMA input conditioning (decay 0.99) on a plain-SGD base:
  our conditioning + THEIR mechanism vs our conditioning + our gate, with
  ``sgd_ema_norm_d099`` the mechanism-free floor. Each factory reduces to
  the shared normalized-SGD base when its mechanism constant is inert
  (pinned).
- ``intentional_updates_*``: a batch-size-one supervised protocol extension
  of Intentional Updates (Sharifnassab et al., arXiv:2604.19033v1).  It
  targets a fixed fractional decrease of current-example surprisal using the
  paper's Eq. 5 and RMSProp diagonal direction.  The registered family pins
  a fixed-step mechanism-off control, diagonal-normalization and clipping
  ablations, and a head-only feature-learning control.  This is not the
  paper's RL algorithm or a publication-equivalent reproduction.

Everything here is a development screening diagnostic — never promotable
scientific evidence. Benchmark executions happen through the CLI
(``run`` / ``merge`` / ``validate-proxy``), never inside pytest.

      minus softmax at the output; ``x_i`` = head input activation ``a2`` for
      ``w3`` and the constant 1 for ``b3``, SwiftTD's bias-feature
      convention), so it is implemented as ``gamma += theta * (-grad) * g``.
    - Sensitivity trace (forward-mode ``g_i ~ d w_i / d gamma_i`` through the
      head update, diagonal/IDBD approximation), with the *new* ``lambda_i``
      and the *pre-update* weight:
      ``g_i <- g_i * max(0, 1 - lambda_i - fade_alpha * x_i^2)
      - lambda_i * w_i``. Both subtractions inside the ``max`` shrink the
      trace, so the contraction factor lies in ``[0, 1]`` (``lambda_i <= 1``)
      and ``|g_i|`` stays bounded by a geometric sum of ``lambda_i * |w_i|``
      -- the stable orientation of the trace recursion.

    Sign-convention reading (chosen so lambda shrinks when decay hurts):
    ``g_i`` accumulates ``-lambda_i * w_i``, i.e. it opposes the sign of a
    decayed weight, while ``delta_t * x_i = -grad_i`` points where descent
    wants the weight to move. When decay hurts (descent wants the weight to
    grow away from zero, ``-grad_i`` aligned with ``w_i``) the product
    ``(-grad_i) * g_i`` is negative and ``gamma_i`` falls (lambda shrinks);
    when decay helps (stale weight the new task's gradient pushes toward
    zero) the product is positive and ``gamma_i`` rises.

    ``fade_alpha`` is FADE's base step-size inside the trace contraction only
    (published 0.005); the applied gradient step keeps the protocol
    ``step_size`` -- UPGD-W's gate, noise, and descent are unchanged on every
    layer. With ``fade_theta_lambda = 0`` and ``fade_gamma0 = -inf``
    (``lambda = 0``) the head reduces exactly to the control update with zero
    head weight decay (pinned by a unit test).

# The automated update-rule discovery lane
# (:mod:`alberta_framework.benchmarks.rule_discovery`) searches a composable
# DSL over the campaign's primitive vocabulary on the micro continual suite.
# Candidates that beat the budget-matched champion-form baseline on the
# held-out micro tasks are translated verbatim into screening arms through
# this factory: one hyperparameter dict carries the mechanism flags
# (``flag_*`` as 0/1 floats) plus the discovered constants. With the
# champion-form flags (norm + shift_reset + gate, everything else off) the
# step is bit-exact against the registered ``sigma0_shiftnorm_d099``
# champion (pinned), so screened differences are attributable to the
# discovered composition alone.

    The pre-registered *existential control* for the screening lane: NO
    backprop, NO MLP — the protocol MLP parameters passed in by the harness
    are returned untouched every step (inert ballast kept only for harness
    shape compatibility). If a fixed random projection with a
    forgetting-factor linear readout matches the deep arms, the benchmark
    measures tracking rather than learning.

    Pipeline per step (predict-then-update, matching the harness ordering):

    1. ``x_norm = ema_normalize(x)`` with the champion's conditioning
       (``norm_decay`` 0.99, ``norm_epsilon`` 1e-8).
    2. ``z = clip(x_norm, -rff_clip, rff_clip)`` — near-zero-variance pixels
       produce extreme z-scores under the 1e-8-epsilon normalizer, which
       would randomize the cosine phases; clipping bounds the phase
       contribution of any single pixel.
    3. ``phi = sqrt(2/m) * cos(Omega @ z + b)`` with frozen
       ``Omega ~ N(0, rff_gamma * I)`` and ``b ~ Uniform[0, 2pi)``.
       ``rff_gamma`` sets the RBF kernel bandwidth: pre-activation variance
       is ``gamma * ||z||^2``; with 784-dim clipped z-scores the calibrated
       value is ~1e-3 (the original 0.05 put pre-activation std at ~6
       radians — pure phase noise — and scored 0.177, barely above chance;
       the 2-task diagnostic sweep recovered 0.79→0.81 at 5e-3→2e-4).
    3. Pre-update prediction ``argmax(Wout.T @ phi)`` scores the protocol's
       online accuracy.
    4. Sherman-Morrison RLS with forgetting factor ``rls_lambda``:
       ``Pp = P @ phi``; ``k = Pp / (lam + phi @ Pp)``;
       ``err = onehot(y) - Wout.T @ phi``; ``Wout += outer(k, err)``;
       ``P = (P - outer(k, Pp)) / lam``, then symmetrized
       (``P = (P + P.T)/2``) against float32 drift.

    The reported loss is the pre-update squared error ``0.5 * ||err||^2``
    (there is no cross-entropy here; per-task losses are NOT comparable with
    the MLP arms' CE — accuracy is the protocol metric). Plasticity is the
    protocol's own post-update one-step improvement ratio computed on the
    same squared-error loss. The RNG key threaded by the harness is
    deliberately unused (the step consumes no randomness).

    Init-key deviation (documented): the screening ``LearnerInitFn`` receives
    only the protocol init params, not the seed key, so the frozen
    ``Omega``/``b`` draw folds the raw float32 bits of the seed-dependent
    ``w1`` init into a fixed domain key — deterministic given the seed,
    distinct across seeds.

# (w) rls_head — champion body + recursive-least-squares readout
# =============================================================================
#
# The convergence-shortfall attack (CEILING_ANALYSIS.md maps 0.029 of the
# champion's error to within-task convergence speed: plateau 0.9037 vs the
# 0.933 family asymptote).  The ``sigma0_shiftnorm_d099`` champion body
# (shift-adaptive EMA-norm decay 0.99 + utility-gated sigma-0 SGD + decoupled
# decay) is kept; the deployed readout becomes streaming recursive least
# squares on the 150-dim penultimate ReLU features (bias-augmented), which is
# exactly optimal for its squared-error objective at every step and converges
# in ~d samples instead of the SGD head's thousands (RFF+RLS precedent:
# 0.848 with a *random* 1024-dim body).
#
# Design decisions (probed by the arm family):
#
# (a) Targets: one-hot least-squares regression + argmax — the standard
#     streaming-classification practice (the rff_rls/lin_rls precedent).
#     Softmax/logistic targets admit no exact RLS recursion (IRLS-style
#     approximations forfeit the closed-form optimality that motivates the
#     arm), and distilling the parallel SGD head's softmax outputs cannot
#     beat its teacher; one-hot regression is therefore fixed by design.
# (b) Forgetting factor ``rls_lambda`` in {0.995, 0.999, 1.0} — RLS's own
#     staleness knob — plus an optional detector-driven P reset
#     (``rls_reset_frac`` <= 1 enables): when the champion's own per-feature
#     shift detector flags more than that fraction of input features in one
#     step, P resets to ``eye/ridge`` (readout weights are KEPT — the reset
#     restores estimation gain without discarding the mapping, mirroring the
#     normalizer's count reset).
# (c) Body error signal: ``head_resid=0`` trains body AND a parallel SGD
#     head with the exact champion update (safer; the six MLP tensors are
#     bit-exact the champion trajectory, pinned) — the RLS head is a pure
#     passenger readout.  ``head_resid=1`` backpropagates the RLS head's own
#     squared-error residual into the body (cleanest single error signal);
#     w3/b3 then pass through untouched, and the utility gate's global-max
#     normalization is guarded at zero utility (neutral gate 0.5) because a
#     zero readout yields exactly zero body gradients at stream start.
#
# Reduction pin: ``rls_ridge_init = inf`` gives P = 0 exactly, so the head
# is frozen at wout = 0 and every prediction is the degenerate constant
# argmax(0) = class 0 (measurable: accuracy = P[y == 0]).  The reported loss
# is the pre-update squared error 0.5*||onehot - logits||^2 (NOT comparable
# with the MLP arms' CE; accuracy is the protocol metric) and plasticity is
# the protocol's post-update one-step improvement on that same loss
# (head update only — the rff_rls precedent).

# within-task re-adaptation transient (first-500-step accuracy 0.659 vs its
# 0.904 plateau), while the naive_bayes arm is FLAT from the first task
# (~0.785 per-task from t1, no transient) because its per-class statistics
# re-estimate at the fast-EMA timescale.  The ensemble deploys an
# accuracy-weighted probability mixture whose weights are learned ONLINE from
# the stream itself: per-member annealed EMAs of each member's own pre-update
# correctness (fast decay, no oracle, no task-boundary signal), squashed
# through a softmax with temperature ``ens_beta``.  Right after a permutation
# the champion's recent-accuracy EMA collapses within tens of steps while the
# NB member's holds, so the vote swings to NB; mid-task the champion
# re-converges above NB and takes the vote back.  Probes: (b) detector-driven
# NB anneal-clock reset (make the NB member itself shift-robust) and (c) a
# third closed-form fast-converging member, linear RLS over normalized pixels
# (the ``lin_rls`` pipeline verbatim).

       shift-adaptive-normalized input; NB: :func:`naive_bayes_logits`;
       optional RLS: readout on clipped z-scores).  The deployed prediction
       is the log-domain accuracy-weighted probability mixture
       ``log sum_m w_m p_m(c)`` with ``w = softmax(ens_beta * member_acc)``;
       the reported loss is the mixture cross-entropy at the true label.
    2. Every member then runs its own arm's exact update on ``(x, y)``.
       Member correctness (each member's own pre-update accuracy metric)
       updates ``member_acc`` with the annealed recurrence
       ``min(ens_decay, 1 - 1/(t + 1))`` — running-average semantics early,
       fast fixed-decay tracking later.  No oracle anywhere: the weights are
       learned from the stream.
    3. Probe (b) (``ens_nb_reset``): a raw-input
       :func:`shift_adaptive_normalize` detector (champion constants)
       reports the per-feature shifted mask; when more than
       ``ens_reset_frac`` of features shift and the last reset is at least
       ``ens_reset_refractory`` steps old, the NB member's class anneal
       clocks reset to zero so its statistics re-estimate at effective decay
       1/2 (means/variances are not zeroed).

    (the registered ``sigma0_shiftnorm_d099`` step), while the member EMAs
    still learn passively.  Plasticity in ensemble mode is the protocol's

    APOLLO (Zhu et al., arXiv 2412.05270, verified against the paper) shows
    AdamW's element-wise learning-rate adaptation can be coarsened to a
    STRUCTURED scaling: project ``R_t = P_t G_t`` with a random Gaussian
    ``P_t in R^{r x m}`` (resampled every T steps), keep AdamW moments in the
    low-rank space, and scale each channel of the raw gradient by the norm
    ratio ``s_j = ||R~_t[:, j]|| / ||R_t[:, j]||`` where
    ``R~_t = M_t^R / (sqrt(V_t^R) + eps)`` — SGD-like memory, AdamW-class
    quality (rank-1 tensor-wise in APOLLO-Mini with a ``sqrt``-heuristic
    scale ``alpha``).

    Batch-1 streaming adaptation (deviations documented):

    - **Exact channel statistics, no projection.** The random projection is
      a memory-saving JL estimator of exactly the per-channel norms the
      scaling consumes; at 300x150 scale with one example per step the exact
      statistics are affordable — the zero-variance limit of the estimator
      (``alpha = 1``, and no subspace-resample schedule applies).
    - **Channel-shared second moment.** ``v_j <- rho * v_j + (1 - rho) *
      mean_i(G_ij^2)`` per channel ``j`` — the fully-coarsened limit of the
      paper's structured-learning-rate thesis.  With the protocol's
      ``beta1 = 0`` (momentum dissected separately by ``sgd_momentum_gate``)
      the norm-ratio scaling collapses to ``1 / (sqrt(v_j) + eps)``, i.e.
      per-channel RMSprop: ``W[:, j]`` steps ``lr * G[:, j] / (sqrt(v_j) +
      eps)``.
    - **Channel = fan-OUT (per-neuron), not the paper's larger-dimension
      convention.**  Deliberate: (a) the fan-in axis is already measured on
      this protocol (``colnorm_gate``, -0.085 at horizon); (b) at batch 1
      the dense-layer gradient is the rank-1 outer product ``x delta^T``,
      so ``||G[:, j]|| = |delta_j| * ||x||`` — per-neuron scaling conditions
      the backprop delta, output-side conditioning that composes with (and
      does not duplicate) the input-side normalizer.
    - **No norm-growth limiter.** The paper's limiter guards early LLM
      gradient spikes; here the current-inclusive EMA normalizer is
      self-bounding (AUDIT.md F3), so the spike source it protects against
      is absent.
    - Biases keep per-element accumulators (1-element channels; pinned
      bitwise against ``norm_rmsprop_gate``'s bias path at matched decay).

    Stability package and application form exactly as the sibling arms:
    champion ``ema_normalize`` (decay 0.99), UPGD utility gate on the

    Ported idea: continuous utility-scaled soft resets (CCBP,
    OpenReview:UJqXhFFzKu; Calibrated Partial Resets, arXiv:2607.24996)
    report that a *continuous*, per-unit-utility-scaled partial pull of
    every hidden parameter toward its initial value dominates both
    decay-based (L2/Shrink-and-Perturb) and hard-reset (CBP/ReDO) methods at
    long horizons. This arm tests that mechanism's isolated marginal
    contribution on top of that historical baseline, reusing the baseline's own
    UPGD utility gate as the per-unit "graded reset" weight: ``1 - gate`` is
    large for low-utility (unprotected) units and near zero for high-utility
    (protected) ones, so the pull toward init is concentrated exactly where
    the source papers' utility-scaled reset is meant to act. ``sigma0_ndecay099``
    exposes no separate hidden-unit-firing utility signal of its own (unlike
    CBP-family arms), so the UPGD gate is the closest available substitute
    -- a documented deviation from the source papers' own utility statistic.

    Deviation from the source papers: they replace their baseline's
    decay/reset term outright; here the pull is an ADDITIVE new term next to
    the baseline's existing uniform decoupled weight decay (rather than a
    replacement), so this measures the isolated contribution of graded,
    utility-gated pull-toward-init rather than a full swap of the
    regularizer family.

    ``l2init_pull_scale = 0`` (the default) is inert: the new term is
    multiplied by exactly zero and the step routes through the identical
    ``lean_upgd_w_update`` call the baseline factory's own inert path uses,
    so the trajectory is bit-exact against ``sigma0_ndecay099`` (pinned by a

    no default protocol, threshold, artifact writer, or evidence path.

    :func:`~alberta_framework.benchmarks.upgd_ipmnist.run_ipmnist` exactly,
    so control arms reproduce the full-horizon lane and every arm shares the
    control's task/example schedule for paired comparison.

    ``noise_mode="pool"`` mirrors ``run_ipmnist(noise_mode="pool")`` --
    including its per-task pool-key split and per-step offset draw, so the
    control arm reproduces the full lane's pool trajectories bit-for-bit
    (pinned by a unit test) -- but consumes ``spec.noise_update`` instead of
    the fixed UPGD-W equations. Pool shards are a screening-only
    approximation: they record ``noise_mode`` and their effective
    ``noise_pool_steps`` and never merge with exact shards nor pass proxy
    validation.

    ``noise_mode="gradual"`` is the deterministic gradual-change protocol
    (#1569): the input mapping ramps from the previous task's permutation to
    the current one across the first ``noise_gradual_steps`` steps of each
    task via ``x = (1 - alpha) * data_x[e][perm_prev] + alpha *
    data_x[e][perm]`` with ``alpha = (i + 1) / noise_gradual_steps`` capped at
    1.0. The ramp draws no RNG keys, so the protocol is fully deterministic
    given the seed, and window 1 collapses bitwise to the abrupt ``step``
    protocol. This lane's tasks differ only by input permutation, so the
    transition is input-side only; labels are invariant across tasks.
    Gradual shards are a screening-only protocol artifact: they record
    ``noise_mode`` and ``noise_gradual_steps`` in a v3 schema, never merge
    with exact shards, never pass proxy validation, and never produce a
    mechanism receipt.
